## 1. Invertibility over $\mathbb{Z}_2$

Let $M$ be a $3\times 3$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_2$. Consider the following matrix.
$$
T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Explain how and why the matrix $MT$ can be inspected to determine whether $M$ is invertible. If $M$ were an $n\times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, what would the dimensions of $T$ have to be (in terms of $n$)?

  If any column in the matrix $MT$ is comprised entirely of 0's, it shows that M can not be inverted. Note that the columns in $T$ represent every possible vector of length 3 in $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This is because the definition of an invertable matrix states that only a zero vector multiplied to the matrix will result in zero vector. In order for $MT$ to produce a useful matrix when the matrix $M$ is $n\times n$, the matrix $T$ would need to be an $2^n-1\times n$ matrix.
  
## 2. Decrypt the Hill Cipher

The following ciphertext was produced by a Hill cipher.
```
jghbqlxdvdohooikfcvqtkxljasmusjh
```
The key used was
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
16 & 6 & 1 & 3 \\
5 & 3 & 0 & 3 \\
10 & 3 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Find the original plaintext. Give the matrix you used to perform the decryption. You can either do this using LaTeX, or by including a code block that prints the matrix.

To decrypt a hill cipher, you encrypt the enciphered text (using another hill cipher) whith a key equal to the inverse of the original key matrix.

In this instance, the new key is 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 25 & 25 & 0 \\
16 & 19 & 10 & 17 \\
20 & 5 & 7 & 1 \\
17 & 9 & 9 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
$$
and the decipherd text is "whatisthecubsmagicnumberrightnow".

## 3. Cracking an LFSR Sequence

The following bit string was produced by a linear recurrence.
$$
1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
$$

1. List the shift matrices of dimensions $2\times 2$ to $6\times 6$. (The first is done for you, and the second is started, so you can see the syntax.)
     $$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, 
     \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix},  \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
     $$
2. Determine which of your shift matrices are invertible, then use the weakness theorem to make a conjecture about the length of the linear recurrence.

Only the 2x2 and the 3x3 matricies are invertable, meaning the linear recurrence is most likely 3.

3. Find the linear recurrence that produced the sequence. You don't need to show all your work, but please give the system of equations that you solved and the solution to the system.

1x+0y+1z=0
0x+1y+0z=0
1x+0y+0z=1

x = 1, y = 0, z = 1

## 4. Make a Good LFSR

In the code block below, write some code that produces a sequence of bits using a linear recurrence of length 7, such that the period of this sequence is greater than 100. Explain how you can tell that the period is greater than 100.
```{r}
#' Note that the period is checked (to see if its greater than 100) within the code
linRec <- function(){
  seedVec <-c(1,0,0,1,0,1,1)
  x <- numeric(100)
  x[1:7] <- seedVec
  for(i in 8:100){
    x[i] <- (x[i-7] + x[i-5] + x[i-3] + x[i-1]) %% 2
    testVec <- x[i:(i+6)]
    if(isTRUE(all.equal(testVec, seedVec))){
      print("Period is less than 100")
      break
    }
    else if(i == 100) print("Period is greater than 100")
  }
}

linRec()


```
